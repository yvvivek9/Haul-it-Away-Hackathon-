Our idea was to introduce an interface for communication between veterans and the NGO.
We made a total of 4 websites,
1) Data of all veterans in the city would be scrapped and displayed on a website and a message would be sent to them if they are willing to help the NGO
2) Interested veterans can apply in NGO's website
3) Doctors can book an appointment when they are free and a notification will be sent to all veterans if no one has visited them in a while
4) A management page for NGO to add or remove volunteer veterans.
